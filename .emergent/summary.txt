The AI engineer's initial task was to understand an existing codebase and then act on a problem statement. Initially, the problem statement was vague, mentioning go through all the links without providing any. The AI explored the provided  directory, identifying a basic React/FastAPI setup. The user then clarified the task, instructing the AI to clone and build the Fhenix Hook project FHEAP - FHE Arbitrage Protection from a specific GitHub repository, emphasizing focusing on smart contracts and FHE integration.

The AI cloned the repository and studied its , gaining a clear understanding of the project's goal: a Uniswap v4 hook using Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) to prevent MEV. The AI initially attempted to modify the existing backend/frontend but was corrected by the user to focus solely on Solidity smart contracts. The bulk of the work then shifted to implementing the FHE smart contracts, libraries, interfaces, and test files using Foundry. The AI encountered significant challenges during compilation, primarily due to incorrect import paths, remapping issues, misuse of the  keyword, duplicate events, and a critical limitation: the Fhenix FHE library for  does not support  or  operations. The trajectory ends with the AI acknowledging this limitation and beginning to refactor  and simplifying the hook's inheritance.

<product_requirements>
The primary objective is to develop FHEAP - FHE Arbitrage Protection, a Uniswap v4 hook that leverages Fhenix's Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) library. This hook aims to protect liquidity providers from Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) by detecting and preventing cross-pool arbitrage. The user explicitly instructed the AI to clone the  GitHub repository, follow its  specifications, and adhere to Fhenix's CoFHE documentation and templates for FHE/CoFHE implementation. The core focus is on building Solidity smart contracts that utilize Fhenix FHE library operations (e.g., , ) within the Uniswap v4 hook architecture, rather than developing a separate backend API or a complex frontend dashboard beyond what's needed for presenting the hook.

<code_architecture>
The project evolved from an initial  structure to primarily a Solidity-based Fhenix Hook.



-   ****: The main Uniswap v4 hook implementing arbitrage protection logic using FHE. Significant edits were made to fix import paths and adapt to FHE library limitations.
-   ****: Contains core logic for calculating arbitrage opportunities homomorphically. Undergoing significant refactoring due to FHE library limitations on   and  operations.
-   ****: Defines access control and permissions using FHE. Modified to correct  keyword usage.
-   ****: Responsible for aggregating price data, potentially involving FHE operations.
-   **, **: Mock contracts for testing the FHE hook without a live Uniswap v4 pool or external oracle. Modified to correct function calls () and  imports.
-   ****: Foundry test file for the FHEAP hook. Edited multiple times to fix imports,  references, and adapt to contract changes.
-   ****: Foundry configuration file. Modified to correctly define dependencies and remappings for compilation.
-   ****: Defines Solidity remappings for cleaner import paths. Crucially updated to resolve compilation errors from duplicate paths.
-   ****: Initial FastAPI backend. Modified to a simplified placeholder as the focus shifted to smart contracts.
-   **, **: React frontend components. Initially modified for a dashboard, then simplified to align with the smart contract focus.

<current_work>
The AI engineer is currently in the process of fixing compilation errors within the Solidity smart contracts, specifically related to the Fhenix FHE library. After successfully setting up Foundry and installing dependencies, numerous compilation issues arose. These included incorrect import paths in various contracts (e.g., , , , ), issues with Solidity's  keyword, duplicate event definitions, and incorrect function calls in mock contracts.

The most critical and recent finding is the limitation of the Fhenix FHE library:  types do not support  or  operations directly. The AI is currently refactoring  to work around this limitation and simplify the  by removing  inheritance and overriding non-virtual functions, as indicated by the last message: Now let me fix the other issues. I need to simplify the hook to not inherit from PermissionedV2 and not override the non-virtual functions. This indicates a fundamental re-evaluation of the FHE logic and contract architecture is underway.

<optional_next_step>
Continue refactoring  and  to address the  / limitations and non-virtual function overrides.
